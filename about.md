# About MIT China Development Initiative

China Development Initiative (CDI) is an MIT student organization founded by MIT undergraduates aiming to:

- provide MIT students with more opportunities to learn about China's development, often through sustainable programs like SLP
- establish connections and bridge the cultural gap between MIT students and students in China
- engage in meaningful exchange with students and thought leaders in China to promote mutual understanding, particularly via forums on leadership, citizenship, and international consciousness

# Service Leadership Program

The [Service Leadership Program](/slp) (better known as SLP) in China promotes mutual cultural and academic exchange in the area of international development. There is no language requirement as the students speak English. Food, housing, and a stipend will be provided. This is the long-time flagship program of CDI.

- Held at least once a year in at least one city in China
- MIT students will mentor distinguished Chinese high school students on the subjects of service and leadership
- Consists of workshops, activities, and community service opportunities

# Other programs in China

Apart from SLP, CDI has also conducted some other intermittent programs in China as well, such as volunteering with HIV/AIDS orphans in Anhui Province, a desertification prevention and management research program in Yinchuan, Ningxia Province, and a English program with Tsinghua.
