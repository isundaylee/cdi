# About SLP

The **Service Leadership Program (SLP)** in China promotes mutual cultural and academic exchange in the area of international development. Launched years ago by MIT undergraduates who share a deep interest in the development of China and recognize the need for education in personal development and social consciousness for students around the world, this program takes place in a city in China where MIT students will mentor distinguished Chinese high school students on the subjects of leadership and service through a series of workshops, activities, and community services opportunities. 

"Light the spark to start the flame" - this is precisely the spirit of the program - its sustainability and impact will help create a network of leaders in MIT and China who will continue to inspire and influence their surroundings as they put their leadership skills and aspirations into practice. 

There is no language requirement as the students speak English. Food, housing, and a stipend will be provided.
